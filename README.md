# Horiseon-Acessibility-Jan2021
UTSA Project 1- accessibility

This repository was to refractor the website for Horiseon, and make it suitable for accessibility.  This project has brought the website up to accessibility standards such that it:

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Changed tags to semantic tags to make them available for accessibility. Ran into problems here as semantic tags needed different coding.

Was able to move images from CSS to the html page, for the oppurtunity to use the alt tag.

Fixed a button malfunction for Search engine optimization.

This project taught me the importance of using semantic tags, and how they are applied to webpages. I struggled with the float and position tags, but in the end was able to make it workout to be a replica of the website with the new features.
